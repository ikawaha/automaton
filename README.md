# Tiny Automaton Framework


This is a simple framework for constructing a little automaton.
To construct an automaton, we only need a set of states, a transition function, and a set of accepting states. 

Input to the automaton can also be sent through channels. 

You can plug in processing while the automaton is running, so it can be used as a transformer rather than as an accepting automaton.

See [sample](./_sample/README.md) for details.
